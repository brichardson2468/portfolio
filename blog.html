                <h3>Week 7 Update</h3>
                <p>
                    <h4>What did you do last week?</h4>
                    
                    This week I officially got my dataset set up and connected. I created the csv file, and set it up using mySQL for testing. I then connected it to my backend and got the basics working.

                    <h4>What do you plan to do this week?</h4>

                    Next week I plan to continue working on my backend. I want to primarily work on trying out some testing, I think I'll start with JUnit. I'll try to keep it basic for now.

                    <h4>Are there any impediments in your way?</h4>

                    I have some experience with testing, but just haven't implemented in Java before. So I'll try to keep it basic to avoid too many issues.

                    <h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?</h4>

                    I'm finding the backend much more difficult than the frontend, so I'll plan my features accordingly to not focus as much on the UI than I previously thought.

                <h3>Week 6 Update</h3>
                <p>
                    <h4>What did you do last week?</h4>

                    The last week I tried to focus on getting my basic dataset built. I ran into some issues integrating it using Java, so I spent a lot more time on that than I was planning for.

                    <h4>What do you plan to do this week?</h4>

                    This week I want to continue working on my backend after I can hopefully get my dataset working.

                    <h4>Are there any impediments in your way?</h4>

                    It seems like things are taking longer to get set up due to having to learn some Java on the go, but I'll make sure to update the features for my project if I start to run into too many issues.

                    <h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?</h4>

                    Now that my website portfolio is out of the way, I think my process is working well and should make some good progress this week.

                <h3>Week 5 Update</h3>
                <p>
                    <h4>What did you do last week?</h4>

                    This week I was able to brush up on my HTML/CSS through another class. I was able to finish up my personal website. Over the weekend I'll add some finishing touches on the UI before submitting. I got a basic frontend working on my project but still working on connecting the backend. With my website out of the way I should be able to devote all my time to project.

                    <h4>What do you plan to do this week?</h4>

                    Connect and start up my backend for my project. I'll make sure to start simple to get something going since I'm new to Java.

                    <h4>Are there any impediments in your way?</h4>

                    Have an exam over the weekend. But should have plenty of time during the week next week.

                    <h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?</h4>

                    I think my process worked well last week. I still think I need to work on laying out more specific weekly goals. It's not something I'm used to doing since I usually just sit down and work for hours at a time without goals. But I understand that can affect my pacing on the project so I'll try to work on that.

                <h3>Week 4 Update</h3>
                <p>
                    <h4>What did you do last week?</h4>
                    
                    As expected with my algorithms exam I had a little less time this week. I finished the assessments of 3 student's projects. I feel I'm at a place with Java that I can move beyond learning into my building phase. I continued to work on my personal website. I also learned some scripting in another class that I think will prove useful for my project.
                    
                    <h4>What do you plan to do this week?</h4>
                    
                    Next week I plan to have my personal website done earlier in the week. Then I can primarily devote 100% of my time to getting my project going. I'll be starting with my backend, with only a minor frontend UI just for testing. So I'll spin up that, then switch to the Java backend.
                    
                    <h4>Are there any impediments in your way?</h4>
                    
                    No impediments in my way. Should be a productive week.
                    
                    <h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?</h4>
                    
                    I think my process worked well last week, with my limited time due to my exam. I think I'll try to improve my process this week by laying out more concrete goals.

                <h3>Week 3 Update</h3>
                <p>
                    <h4>What did you do last week?</h4>

                    I was sick this past week, so I didn't get as much accomplished as I wanted to. I continued learning Java on Exercism, but primarily was working on getting my personal website up. I have a domain so I had to learn how to deploy my website and get things set up properly. Still a lot of work to do on the site but I'm making progress. I also finalized and submitted my initial project proposal.

                    <h4>What do you plan to do this week?</h4>

                    Next week I hope to get a lot more done, and hopefully finish off learning the basics of Java that I'll need for my project. I hope to be heading towards the basic MVP of my personal site so that I can begin working primarily on my project. 

                    <h4>Are there any impediments in your way?</h4>

                    I have an Algorithms exam on Tuesday, so I'll have to good with my time management this week since I'll need to be spending a lot of time studying for that. 

                    <h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?</h4>

                    Being sick definitely threw a wrench in the gears and makes you appreciate being healthy. Even though I was still working, it wasn't until reflecting on this past week that it becomes so obvious how illness affects the quality of your work. So the main thing for next week is to just get healthy and get back to work!

                <h3>Week 2 Update</h3>
                <p>
                    <h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>

                    This week I primarily focused on getting my portfolio website up and running implementing the HTML, CSS, and Javascript functionality. I also started my journey towards learning Java by enrolling in a course and getting down the basic syntax. Knowing the importance of object orientation to Java I also brushed up on relearning that topic.

                    <h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

                    Next week I plan to start project and get the basic frontend setup going. I'll start exploring ideas for the backend but want to have a more solid Java footing before diving too deep into that yet.

                    <h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?</h4>

                    Something that went well I think was I tried to not go too deep before getting my foundations first. When learning something new it can be exciting to rabbit hole down many different topics before knowing the actual importance of the topics. But taking a slow iterative approach I feel like I accomplished a lot without over extending.

                    <h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?</h4>

                    I mostly want to try to spread out the work more evenly. As appealing as a single chunk of time to learn is, the learning process is facilitated by spreading it out and learning just a little bit each day. The repetition will help me retain things better.
