        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            After graduating Emory University with a degree in Neuroscience I worked in healthcare for 10 years,
            everything from a lab, to an EMT on an ambulance, to a geriatric psychiatric hospital unit. I
            then attended medical school before deciding to make the career switch to software engineering
            during the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            With my previous experience in healthcare and my new found passion for software, I hope to break
            into the health tech industry and help build the next generation of healthcare technology.
